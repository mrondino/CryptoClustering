Project Title: Module 19 Assignment - CryptoClustering

Description: This script runs through a set of data, reads it, and clusters the data using different methods. At the end, it compares the methods to see which is best for the data.

File Structure: The Python file contains the script that should be run. The "crypto_market_data" file contains the data that will be called in.

Code Source: I utlized the Xpert Learning Assistant to assist me in some syntax, and greatly utilized the syntax from the 19-Unsupervised-Learning Activites, especially when plotting the Elbow curves and scatter plots.

Author: Myself, Madeline Rondino.
